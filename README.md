# Random Dragon Name

Got bored, decided to play with `C` and `Swift`. So I made a small script to print a random dragon name from GOT and HOTD.

## Usage 

After cloning, run `make` and then pick your poison. 

```
$  make
cd C && cc dragon.c -o dragon
cd Swift && swiftc dragon.swift -o dragon

$ C/dragon
Ghiscar

$ % Swift/dragon 
Arrax
```
